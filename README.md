# What should I bring?
Laptop or another device with good screen size so that typing programs, editing and debugging is easier.

# What would be our focus?
It is a workshop to introduce Python as a programming language. As much as we want to but due to time constraint we will not be able to dive into Data Science and Web Development details. Stay tuned, we will touch upon Object Oriented Programming!

# What should I be ready for?
Follow along, type code samples, do hands on exercises. It will be fun!




_See you soon!_
